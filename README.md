# Room-Occupancy-Detection

This project was done for the Real Time Intelligent Systems course in the University of Chicago Master of Analytics program by Glory Scheel and Arnav Tayal.<br/>
The goal of this project was to create a system that accepts streaming data, attributes about a room, to detect if the room is occupied or not. 
This analysis utlized the following Python packages:<br/>
-Pandas<br/>
-NumPy<br/>
-MatplotLib<br/>
-SkLearn<br/>
-Keras<br/>
-Socket<br/>

After finding a solution to connecting the client to the server to accept the streaming data we trained a Dense Layer Neural Network to make predictions on whether the room was occupied or not, 1 or 0. The model showed a high accuracy and low loss.
